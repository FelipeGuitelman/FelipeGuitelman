### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felipe Guitelman, I'm a 26 year old full stack developer. This year I finished my studies at Henry where I learned to work with technologies like React and Redux on the Front-end, and NodeJS, Express and Sequelize on the Back-end, and how to work in teams with agile methodologies like SCRUM. Able to work under pressure and always willing to solve problems and look for scalable solutions. I have analytical capacity and interest in constant learning.
